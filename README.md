# California Recall Simulation

This is a simulation of the California gubernatorial recall system discussed in the paper "The irrationality of the California gubernatorial recall system" by Wes Holliday (wesholliday@berkeley.edu) and Eric Pacuit (epacuit@umd.edu).

1. The main simulation is in the file ca_recall_simulation.ipynb.
2. The 'data' folder contains the data produced by the simulation.
3. Code to produce Figures 12, 13, and 15 is in the file ca_recall_visualization.ipynb.
4. Code to produce Figures 10, 11, and 14 is in the file visualize_dirichlet.ipynb.
5. An implementation of the urn process described in Box 1 is in the file dirichlet_urn_process.ipynb.
